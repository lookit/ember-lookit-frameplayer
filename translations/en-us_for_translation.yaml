    click-here-to-detect: click here to detect
    see-troubleshooting: See the troubleshooting directions below if you're having trouble!
    step-1: Make sure you can see yourself to the left! You may need to click "Allow" so that we can access your webcam and microphone. On Firefox, make sure to also check "Remember this decision"!
    looks-good: Looks good!
    no-webcam-detected: No webcam detected
    step-2-click-directions: Make sure your webcam settings got saved by clicking
    reload-button-label: this button
    step-2-what-should-happen: Your webcam should re-appear WITHOUT you having to allow access again. (If you do see a dialogue, click "Remember this decision" or "Always allow" and try again!)
    step-3: Make sure we'll be able to hear you! This box will be filled in once we hear a loud enough sound
    sounds-good: Sounds good!
    try-clapping: Try clapping or saying hi.
    step-2-warning: Please press the 'reload webcam' button first to make sure it shows up again without making you click to allow.
    step-3-warning: Please check that your recording audio is loud enough first. Make some noise!
    camera-access-warning: We don't seem to have camera access. Are you on a computer (not a phone or tablet), and using Chrome or Firefox? If so, see the troubleshooting info below.
    setup-tips-header: Setup tips and troubleshooting
    supported-setup: Check your device and browser
    mobile-devices: Are you using a phone or tablet? Lookit only works on computers so far - we're hoping to support mobile devices soon! Please visit again from a computer.
    browser-support: Are you using a web browser other than Chrome or Firefox (like Internet Explorer or Safari)? If so, please try again using Chrome or Firefox. These are the only browsers Lookit currently supports.
    chrome-instructions-header: Camera setup instructions for Chrome
    chrome-directions-prompt: When you load this page for the first time, you should see a prompt like the one below. Click "Allow" to let Lookit access the webcam and microphone.
    chrome-directions-set-perms: If you didn't see that prompt, or if you clicked "Block," you can change the settings by clicking on the green lock icon next to the URL. Set Camera and Microphone (and Sound if it's shown) all to "Allow," and then refresh this page.
    chrome-select-mic: <em>Having trouble passing the sound check?</em> Chrome may be using the wrong input device - unfortunately it doesn't let you pick which microphone when you click "Allow". You can select the correct microphone at chrome://settings/content/microphone (copy and paste that as a URL). Then refresh this page to try again.
    chrome-select-camera: <em>Seeing the wrong camera view</em> - like your built-in laptop camera instead of a USB webcam? You can select the correct camera at chrome://settings/content/camera (copy and paste that as a URL). Then refresh this page to try again.

    firefox-directions-prompt: When you load this page for the first time, you should see a prompt like the one below. Select the camera and microphone you want to use, check "Remember this decision," and click "Allow".
    firefox-directions-set-perms: If you didn't see that prompt, or if you clicked "Don't Allow" at first, you can change the settings by clicking on crossed-out camera and/or microphone next to the URL. Click the "X" next to each setting, then refresh the page.
    additional-troubleshooting-header: It's just not working - what else can I try?
    additional-troubleshooting-intro: First, you are a very dedicated citizen scientist and we're grateful for your help! We're sorry you're having trouble.
    camera-check: Make sure you're able to view your webcam video outside of Lookit. (For example, on a Mac, try Photobooth.)
    try-another-browser: The easiest approach is to try a different web browser if you have one installed anyway. For instance, if you're using Firefox, switch to Chrome, or vice versa. Also, update the browser if you're not using the latest version. You can check by going to "Chrome" -> "About Chrome" or "Firefox" -> "About Firefox" in the menu bar. (This is a good idea to make sure you've gotten any security updates anyway.)
    chrome-incognito: Using Chrome? Make sure you're not using an Incognito window - you won't be able to save and use settings throughout the study.
    additional-troubleshooting-contact: If you're stumped, it's our fault. Please let us know so we can improve the site! Email us at lookit-tech@mit.edu with a short description of what's happening.

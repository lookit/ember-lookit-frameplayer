See <strong>&ldquo;Who will be able to see our video recordings&rdquo;</strong> for more information and your choices.</li>}}</ol>"
    data-use-researchers-header: What will you use this information for?
    data-use-researchers-content: We will never use any of your information for any purpose other than non-profit research.<br><br>The results of this study may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. We may publish individual responses from your de-identified (2) study information (see <strong>“How do you make sure my privacy is protected?”</strong>), like how long your child looked at a picture or which button they decided to press, but this will only be shared in a way similar to “one of the many five-year-olds who participated chose this option during the study” or “participant number five chose this option during the study.”<br><br>We will <strong>never share or publish</strong> personal information like your email or children's birth dates or names.
    data-access-header: Who has access to this information?
    data-access-content: Running studies like ours online requires a small number of specific people at two universities to have access to all three types of information. At {institution}, our research group and {institution} Institutional Review Board (IRB), which is a group that makes sure your rights are protected when you participate in research, have access. At MIT, the administrative staff who run Lookit have access. To learn more about Lookit or the {institution} IRB, please see the specific questions about them below.<br><br>Only people approved by the {institution} Institutional Review Board (IRB) to be on this study's research team or Lookit staff will have access to your personal information. Your personal information will only be used to make sure that you agreed to the study and to contact you about this study or future Project GARDEN studies, including sending you gift cards.<br><br>Your study information will be shared with other Project GARDEN researchers and eventually other child development researchers outside Project GARDEN, but we take multiple steps to de-identify you and protect your privacy by removing personal information before doing so.<br><br>Your video recordings will be shared or not shared according to the option you choose at the end of the study.
    data-management-header: 'How do you make sure that my privacy is protected with "de-identification"?'
    data-management-content: 'Your <u>study information</u> will be de-identified by giving you and your child a “Family ID” and removing any personal information that can be used to identify you. We can give you two examples of how this “de-identification process” works:<br><br><u>Example #1</u>: In our research spreadsheets, we will use something like “F32” or “Family 32” to identify your family/your child instead of “the Smith family” or “Jane Smith”. This de-identified <u>study information</u> will be placed together with other families&rsquo; de-identified study information in spreadsheets/data files.<br><br><u>Example #2</u>: If your child is 5 years old, their information will usually be described as one of many other 5 year olds in the data set, and we will report findings saying something like “five-year-olds in this study were more likely to choose option A more often than other options” or “200 families with five-year-olds were in the Southeast U.S.”.<br><br>If you have any more questions about who has access to your information or how it will be used, please contact us using the information at the end of this consent form. We would also be happy to share examples of papers we have published before so you can see how we use this information without identifying participating families (except in cases where they chose to share their video recordings with the public).'
    data-sharing-header: Will you ever share my information with anyone else?
    data-sharing-content: Once your <u>study information</u> is de-identified (see <strong>“How do you make sure my privacy is protected?”</strong>), it will be shared with other Project GARDEN researchers at other universities and will be used to write up research findings which will be shared with the public. The de-identified study information will also eventually be shared with the public so other researchers can verify these findings and also see if there are other important things we can learn from the information. This will allow educators, families and other researchers to use the findings to {data_sharing_learn}.<br><br>You will have full control over which Project GARDEN studies you do or do not wish to participate in. You are only agreeing to participate in {experiment} with this consent form.

    step-2-what-should-happen: Your webcam should re-appear WITHOUT you having to allow access again. (If you do see a dialogue, click "Remember this decision" or "Always allow" and try again!)
    step-3: Make sure we'll be able to hear you! This box will be filled in once we hear a loud enough sound
    sounds-good: Sounds good!
    try-clapping: Try clapping or saying hi.
    step-2-warning: Please press the 'reload webcam' button first to make sure it shows up again without making you click to allow.
    step-3-warning: Please check that your recording audio is loud enough first. Make some noise!
    camera-access-warning: We don't seem to have camera access. Are you on a computer (not a phone or tablet), and using Chrome or Firefox? If so, see the troubleshooting info below.
    setup-tips-header: Setup tips and troubleshooting
    supported-setup: Check your device and browser
    mobile-devices: Are you using a phone or tablet? Lookit only works on computers so far - we're hoping to support mobile devices soon! Please visit again from a computer.
    browser-support: Are you using a web browser other than Chrome or Firefox (like Internet Explorer or Safari)? If so, please try again using Chrome or Firefox. These are the only browsers Lookit currently supports.
    chrome-instructions-header: Camera setup instructions for Chrome
    chrome-directions-prompt: When you load this page for the first time, you should see a prompt like the one below. Click "Allow" to let Lookit access the webcam and microphone.
    chrome-directions-set-perms: If you didn't see that prompt, or if you clicked "Block," you can change the settings by clicking on the green lock icon next to the URL. Set Camera and Microphone (and Sound if it's shown) all to "Allow," and then refresh this page.
    chrome-select-mic: <em>Having trouble passing the sound check?</em> Chrome may be using the wrong input device - unfortunately it doesn't let you pick which microphone when you click "Allow". You can select the correct microphone at chrome://settings/content/microphone (copy and paste that as a URL). Then refresh this page to try again.
    chrome-select-camera: <em>Seeing the wrong camera view</em> - like your built-in laptop camera instead of a USB webcam? You can select the correct camera at chrome://settings/content/camera (copy and paste that as a URL). Then refresh this page to try again.

    firefox-instructions-header: Camera setup instructions for Firefox
    firefox-directions-prompt: When you load this page for the first time, you should see a prompt like the one below. Select the camera and microphone you want to use, check "Remember this decision," and click "Allow".
    firefox-directions-set-perms: If you didn't see that prompt, or if you clicked "Don't Allow" at first, you can change the settings by clicking on crossed-out camera and/or microphone next to the URL. Click the "X" next to each setting, then refresh the page.
    additional-troubleshooting-header: It's just not working - what else can I try?
    additional-troubleshooting-intro: First, you are a very dedicated citizen scientist and we're grateful for your help! We're sorry you're having trouble.
    camera-check: Make sure you're able to view your webcam video outside of Lookit. (For example, on a Mac, try Photobooth.)
    try-another-browser: The easiest approach is to try a different web browser if you have one installed anyway. For instance, if you're using Firefox, switch to Chrome, or vice versa. Also, update the browser if you're not using the latest version. You can check by going to "Chrome" -> "About Chrome" or "Firefox" -> "About Firefox" in the menu bar. (This is a good idea to make sure you've gotten any security updates anyway.)
    chrome-incognito: Using Chrome? Make sure you're not using an Incognito window - you won't be able to save and use settings throughout the study.
    additional-troubleshooting-contact: If you're stumped, it's our fault. Please let us know so we can improve the site! Email us at lookit-tech@mit.edu with a short description of what's happening.

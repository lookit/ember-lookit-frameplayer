    data-collection-header: Data collection and webcam recording
    data-collection-1: During the session, you and your child will be recorded via your computer's webcam and microphone. Video recordings and other data you enter are sent securely to the Lookit platform and stored indefinitely. At the end of the session, you will be prompted to choose a privacy level for your webcam recordings. You will have the option to withdraw your video data at this point. You can view your past recordings on Lookit under "Studies" -> "Your past studies" at any time.
    data-collection-2: Data is stored securely on Lookit servers and by researchers. However, there is always a small risk that data transmitted over the internet may be intercepted or that the security of stored data may be compromised.
    data-collection-3: No video clips will be published or shared unless you allow this when selecting a privacy level. If we do not receive a consent recording (the video you'll make to the right) for this session and cannot verify that you agreed to participate, no other video from your session will be viewed.

    data-use-researchers-content-2: This includes changes you make in the future to any of this information. We may put different types of information together to learn more about child development. For instance, if your child participates in multiple studies from our group, we may look at how his or her responses compare across studies, or we may look at whether siblings tend to respond similarly. We may also study connections between children’s responses and family demographic survey data.
    data-use-Lookit-header: How Lookit uses your data
    data-use-Lookit-content: The Lookit core team at MIT will also have access to the data collected during this session, in addition to your account data. They use this data to run and improve Lookit, for instance to provide technical support, check how well data collection is working, or see whether Lookit is reaching a diverse group of families. Lookit stores data indefinitely unless you withdraw your recordings at the end of the study.
    publication-header: Publishing the results of this study
    publication-contents: The results of this study may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. We may publish individual responses that cannot identify children, like looking times or sequences of button presses. We never publish children’s birthdates or names. Even if you choose to share your recordings, we never publish information that would make it possible to link recordings with your demographic data.
    research-subject-rights-header: Your rights as a participant
    gdpr-header: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) information

    supported-setup: Check your device and browser
    mobile-devices: Are you using a phone or tablet? Lookit only works on computers so far - we're hoping to support mobile devices soon! Please visit again from a computer.
    browser-support: Are you using a web browser other than Chrome or Firefox (like Internet Explorer or Safari)? If so, please try again using Chrome or Firefox. These are the only browsers Lookit currently supports.
    chrome-instructions-header: Camera setup instructions for Chrome
    chrome-directions-prompt: When you load this page for the first time, you should see a prompt like the one below. Click "Allow" to let Lookit access the webcam and microphone.
    chrome-directions-set-perms: If you didn't see that prompt, or if you clicked "Block," you can change the settings by clicking on the green lock icon next to the URL. Set Camera and Microphone (and Sound if it's shown) all to "Allow," and then refresh this page.
    chrome-select-mic: <em>Having trouble passing the sound check?</em> Chrome may be using the wrong input device - unfortunately it doesn't let you pick which microphone when you click "Allow". You can select the correct microphone at chrome://settings/content/microphone (copy and paste that as a URL). Then refresh this page to try again.
    chrome-select-camera: <em>Seeing the wrong camera view</em> - like your built-in laptop camera instead of a USB webcam? You can select the correct camera at chrome://settings/content/camera (copy and paste that as a URL). Then refresh this page to try again.

    additional-troubleshooting-header: It's just not working - what else can I try?
    additional-troubleshooting-intro: First, you are a very dedicated citizen scientist and we're grateful for your help! We're sorry you're having trouble.
    camera-check: Make sure you're able to view your webcam video outside of Lookit. (For example, on a Mac, try Photobooth.)
    try-another-browser: The easiest approach is to try a different web browser if you have one installed anyway. For instance, if you're using Firefox, switch to Chrome, or vice versa. Also, update the browser if you're not using the latest version. You can check by going to "Chrome" -> "About Chrome" or "Firefox" -> "About Firefox" in the menu bar. (This is a good idea to make sure you've gotten any security updates anyway.)
    chrome-incognito: Using Chrome? Make sure you're not using an Incognito window - you won't be able to save and use settings throughout the study.
    additional-troubleshooting-contact: If you're stumped, it's our fault. Please let us know so we can improve the site! Email us at lookit-tech@mit.edu with a short description of what's happening.

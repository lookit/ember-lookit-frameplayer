.. _random-parameter-set:

random-parameter-set
==============================================

Overview
------------------

Randomizer that provides flexible condition assignment and counterbalancing by
allowing the user to specify an arbitrary sequence of frames to create. A
set of parameters is randomly selected from a list of available ``parameterSets``,
and these parameters are substituted in to the parameters specified in the
list of frames.

To use, define a frame with 'kind': 'choice' and 'sampler': 'random-parameter-set',
as shown below, in addition to the parameters described under 'properties'.

.. code::

   {
       ...
       "frames": {
           ...
           "test-trials": {
               "sampler": "random-parameter-set",
               "kind": "choice",
               ...
           }
       }
   }

In addition, there are two special properties you need to define to
use the ``random-parameter-set`` randomizer:

- ``frameList``: this is just what it sounds like: a list of all the frames
  that should be generated by this randomizer. Each frame is a JSON object
  just like you would use in the overall schema, with two differences:

  - You can define default properties, to share across all of the frames
    generated by this randomizer, in the JSON object
    ``commonFrameProperties`` instead, as a convenience.

  - You can use placeholder strings for any of the properties in the frame;
    they will be replaced based on the values in the selected
    ``parameterSet``.

- ``parameterSets`` is a list of mappings from placeholder strings to
  actual values. When a participant starts your study, one of these sets
  will be randomly selected, and any parameter values in the ``frameList``
  (including ``commonFrameProperties``) that match any of the keys in this
  parameter set will be replaced.


.. admonition:: Advanced options for choosing the parameterSet

   You can `determine the weights based on the child's age <https://lookit.github.io/lookit-frameplayer-docs/classes/Random-parameter-set.html#property_parameterSetWeights>`_, to maintain balanced conditions.) You can also `keep kids in the same condition across all sessions they complete, or rotate them through conditions in order  <https://lookit.github.io/lookit-frameplayer-docs/classes/Random-parameter-set.html#property_conditionForAdditionalSessions>`_.


Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s walk through an example of using this randomizer. Suppose we start
with the following JSON document describing a study that includes
instructions, an experimental manipulation asking participants to think
about how delicious broccoli is, and an exit survey:

.. code:: json

   {
       "frames": {
          "instructions": {
              "id": "text-1",
              "blocks": [
                  {
                      "text": "Some introductory text about this study."
                  },
                  {
                      "text": "Here's what's going to happen! You're going to think about how tasty broccoli is."
                  }
              ],
              "showPreviousButton": false,
              "kind": "exp-lookit-text"
          },
          "manipulation": {
              "id": "text-2",
              "blocks": [
                  {
                      "text": "Think about how delicious broccoli is."
                  },
                  {
                      "text": "It is so tasty!"
                  }
              ],
              "showPreviousButton": true,
              "kind": "exp-lookit-text"
          },
          "exit-survey": {
               "debriefing": {
                   "text": "Thank you for participating in this study! ",
                   "title": "Thank you!"
               },
               "id": "exit-survey",
               "kind": "exp-lookit-exit-survey"
           }
       },
       "sequence": [
           "instructions",
           "manipulation",
           "exit-survey"
       ]
   }

But what we really want to do is have some kids think about how tasty
broccoli is, and others think about how yucky it is! We can use a
``random-parameter-set`` frame to replace both text frames:

.. code:: json

   {
       "frames": {
           "instruct-and-manip": {
               "sampler": "random-parameter-set",
               "kind": "choice",
               "id": "instruct-and-manip",
               "frameList": [
                   {
                      "blocks": [
                          {
                              "text": "Some introductory text about this study."
                          },
                          {
                              "text": "INTROTEXT"
                          }
                      ],
                      "showPreviousButton": false
                   },
                   {
                      "blocks": [
                          {
                              "text": "MANIP-TEXT-1"
                          },
                          {
                              "text": "MANIP-TEXT-2"
                          }
                      ],
                      "showPreviousButton": true
                  }
               ],
               "commonFrameProperties": {
                   "kind": "exp-lookit-text"
               },
               "parameterSets": [
                   {
                       "INTROTEXT": "Here's what's going to happen! You're going to think about how tasty broccoli is.",
                       "MANIP-TEXT-1": "Think about how delicious broccoli is.",
                       "MANIP-TEXT-2": "It is so tasty!"
                   },
                   {
                       "INTROTEXT": "Here's what's going to happen! You're going to think about how disgusting broccoli is.",
                       "MANIP-TEXT-1": "Think about how disgusting broccoli is.",
                       "MANIP-TEXT-2": "It is so yucky!"
                   }
               ]
           },
          "exit-survey": {
               "debriefing": {
                   "text": "Thank you for participating in this study! ",
                   "title": "Thank you!"
               },
               "id": "exit-survey",
               "kind": "exp-lookit-exit-survey"
           }
       },
       "sequence": [
           "instruct-and-manip",
           "exit-survey"
       ]
   }

Notice that since both of the frames in the ``frameList`` were of the
same kind, we could define the kind in ``commonFrameProperties``. We no
longer define ``id`` values for the frames, as they will be
automatically identified as ``instruct-and-manip-1`` and
``instruct-and-manip-2``.

When the “instruct-and-manip” randomizer is evaluated, the Lookit
experiment player will start with the frameList and add the key-value
pairs in commonFrameProperties to each frame (not overwriting existing
pairs):

.. code:: javascript

   [
       {
           "kind": "exp-lookit-text",
           "blocks": [
               {
                   "text": "Some introductory text about this study."
               },
               {
                   "text": "INTROTEXT"
               }
           ],
           "showPreviousButton": false
       },
       {
           "kind": "exp-lookit-text",
           "blocks": [
               {
                   "text": "MANIP-TEXT-1"
               },
               {
                   "text": "MANIP-TEXT-2"
               }
           ],
           "showPreviousButton": true
       }
   ]

Next, one of the two objects in ``parameterSets`` is selected randomly.
(By default, parameter sets are weighted equally, but
``parameterSetWeights`` can be provided as an optional key in the
``random-parameter-set`` frame. If provided, ``parameterSetWeights``
should be an array of relative weights for the parameter sets,
corresponding to the order they are listed. For instance, if we wanted
75% of participants to think about how tasty broccoli is, we could set
``parameterSetWeights`` to [3, 1]. This allows uneven condition
assignment where needed to optimize power, as well as allowing
researchers to stop testing conditions that already have enough
participants as data collection proceeds.

Suppose that in this case the second parameter set is selected:

.. code:: json

    {
    "INTROTEXT": "Here's what's going to happen! You're going to think about how disgusting broccoli is.",
    "MANIP-TEXT-1": "Think about how disgusting broccoli is.",
    "MANIP-TEXT-2": "It is so yucky!"
    }

Now we return to the list of frames, and wherever any value matches one
of the keys in the ``parameterSet`` (even if that value is nested in
another object), it is replaced by the corresponding value from the
``parameterSet``, yielding the following final list of frames:

::

   [
       {
           "kind": "exp-lookit-text",
           "blocks": [
               {
                   "text": "Some introductory text about this study."
               },
               {
                   "text": "Here's what's going to happen! You're going to think about how disgusting broccoli is."
               }
           ],
           "showPreviousButton": false
       },
       {
           "kind": "exp-lookit-text",
           "blocks": [
               {
                   "text": "Think about how disgusting broccoli is."
               },
               {
                   "text": "It is so yucky!"
               }
           ],
           "showPreviousButton": true
       }
   ]


Parameters
----------------

commonFrameProperties [Object]
    Object describing common parameters to use in EVERY frame created
    by this randomizer. Parameter names and values are as described in
    the documentation for the frameType used.

frameList [Array]
    List of frames to be created by this randomizer. Each frame is an
    object with any necessary frame-specific properties specified. The
    ``kind`` of frame can be specified either here (per frame) or in
    ``commonFrameProperties``. If a property is defined for a given frame both
    in this frame list and in ``commonFrameProperties``, the value in the frame
    list will take precedence.

    (E.g., you could include ``'kind': 'normal-frame'`` in
    ``commmonFrameProperties``, but for a single frame in ``frameList``, include
    ``'kind': 'special-frame'``.)

    Any property *values* within any of the frames in this list which match
    a property *name* in the selected ``parameterSet`` will be replaced by the
    corresponding ``parameterSet`` value. For example, suppose a frame in ``frameList`` is

    .. code:: javascript

        {
            'leftImage': 'LEFTIMAGE1',
            'rightImage': 'frog.jpg',
            'size': 'IMAGESIZE'
        }

    and the row that has been selected randomly of `parameterSets` is

    .. code:: javascript

        {
            'LEFTIMAGE1': 'toad.jpg',
            'LEFTIMAGE2': 'dog.jpg',
            'IMAGESIZE': 250
        }

    Then the frame would be transformed into:

    .. code:: javascript

        {
            'leftImage': 'toad.jpg',
             'rightImage': 'frog.jpg',
             'size': 250
        }

    The same values may be applied across multiple frames. For instance,
    suppose `frameList` is

    .. code:: javascript

        [
            {
                'leftImage': 'LEFTIMAGE1',
                'rightImage': 'frog.jpg',
                'size': 'IMAGESIZE'
            },
            {
                'leftImage': 'LEFTIMAGE2',
                'rightImage': 'frog.jpg',
                'size': 'IMAGESIZE'
            }
        ]

    Then the corresponding processed frames would include the values

    .. code:: javascript

        [
            {
                'leftImage': 'toad.jpg',
                'rightImage': 'frog.jpg',
                'size': 250
            },
            {
                'leftImage': 'dog.jpg',
                'rightImage': 'frog.jpg',
                'size': 250
            }
        ]

    A property value like ``IMAGESIZE`` may be placed in a frame definition
    nested within another object (at any depth) or within a list and
    will still be replaced.

    You can also use selectors to randomly sample from or permute
    a list given in a ``parameterSet``. Suppose ``LISTVAR`` is defined in
    a ``parameterSet`` as ``THELIST``, e.g. a list of potential stimuli. Within frames in your ``frameList``
    (and in ``commonFrameProperties``), you can use any of the following:

    - Select the Nth element (0-indexed) of ``THELIST``: (Will cause error if ``N >= THELIST.length``)

      .. code:: javascript

          'parameterName': 'LISTVAR#N'

    - Select (uniformly) a random element of ``THELIST``:

      .. code:: javascript

          'parameterName': 'LISTVAR#RAND'

    - Set ``parameterName`` to a random permutation of ``THELIST``:

      .. code:: javascript

          'parameterName': 'LISTVAR#PERM'

    - Select the next element in a random permutation of ``THELIST``, which is used across all
      substitutions in this randomizer. This allows you, for instance, to provide a list
      of possible images in your ``parameterSet``, and use a different one each frame with the
      subset/order randomized per participant. If more ``LISTVAR_UNIQ`` parameters than
      elements of ``THELIST`` are used, we loop back around to the start of the permutation
      generated for this randomizer.

      .. code:: javascript

          'parameterName': 'LISTVAR#UNIQ'

parameterSets [Array]
    Array of parameter sets to randomly select from in order to determine
    the parameters for each frame in this session.

    A single element of `parameterSets` will be applied to a given session.

conditionForAdditionalSessions [String | ``'random'``]

    [Optional] How to select a parameterSet for a participant who has previously
    participated in this study. Must be one of ``'random'`` (default), ``'persist'``, or
    ``'rotate'``. Meanings:

    - ``random``: regardless of any previous sessions from this participant, select a
      parameterSet for this participant as usual (including using parameterSetWeights if
      provided). Default behavior.

    - ``persist``: Continue assigning the same participant to the same parameterSet for all
      sessions.

    - ``rotate``: The first time, assign parameterSet randomly (per parameterSetWeights if
      given); after that, each time the participant participates assign them to the next
      parameterSet in the list. Subtracts length of parameterSets until the 'next' index
      is in range.

    The most recent session in which the ``conditions`` data includes an element that looks
    like it was generated by this same randomizer (i.e., with key ending in ``-frameId``,
    like ``-test-trials``) will always be used for assignment.

    Only sessions with a completed consent frame are considered, so that participants are
    not rotated through conditions simply due to refreshing the setup page.

    The "same" or "next" parameterSets are determined by the **index** of the
    previously-selected parameterSet. That is, if you were assigned to conditionNum 0
    (index 0 in parameterSets) last time, you will be assigned to conditionNum 0 again
    this time if ``conditionForAdditionalSessions`` is ``"persist"`` and conditionNum 1 if
    ``conditionForAdditionalSessions`` is ``"rotate"``. So if you update the list of ``parameterSets``
    in your study - e.g. to fix a bug or clarify wording - the new values will be used
    even for repeat participants. But be careful that you do not reorder them unless you
    intend to, say, swap all participants to the opposite condition on a specified date!

    If the previous index is now outside the range of the ``parameterSets`` list (e.g., you
    used to have 6 conditions, and the participant was previously in condition number 5,
    but then you changed ``parameterSets`` to have only 3 elements) and ``conditionForAdditionalSessions`` is
    ``"persist"``, then the participant is assigned to the last element of ``parameterSets``.

parameterSetWeights [Array]

    [Optional] Array of weights for parameter sets; elements correspond to
    elements of parameterSets. The probability of selecting an element
    ``parameterSets[i]`` is ``parameterSetWeights[i]/sum(parameterSetWeights)``.

    If not provided, all ``parameterSets`` are weighted equally.

    This is intended to allow manual control of counterbalancing during
    data collection, e.g. to allow one condition to 'catch up' if it was
    randomly selected less often.

    Instead of providing a single list of the same length as parameterSets,
    you may instead provide a list of objects specifying the weights to use within
    various age ranges, like this:

    .. code:: javascript

        'parameterSetWeights': [
            {
                'minAge': 0,
                'maxAge': 365,
                'weights': [1, 0, 1]
            },
            {
                'minAge': 365,
                'maxAge': 10000,
                'weights': [0, 1, 0]
            },
        ]

    The child's age in days will be computed, and the weights used will be based on the
    first element of ``parameterSetWeights`` where the child falls between the min and max
    age. In the example above, children under one year old will be assigned to either
    the first or third condition; children over a year will be assigned to the second condition.
    This may be useful for researchers who need to balance condition assignment per
    age bracket. As you code data and realize you are set on 3-year-olds in condition A, for
    instance, you can stop assigning any more 3-year-olds to that condition.

Data collected
----------------

The information returned by this randomizer will be available in ``expData["conditions"]["THIS-RANDOMIZER-ID"]``. The
randomizer ID will depend on its order in the study - for instance, ``6-test-trials``.

conditionNum [Number]
    the index of the parameterSet chosen

parameterSet [Object]
    the parameterSet chosen

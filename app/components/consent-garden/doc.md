# exp-lookit-video-consent: consent-GARDEN template


## Overview

Video consent frame for Lookit studies, with consent document displayed at left and instructions to start recording, read a statement out loud, and send. A standard consent
document is displayed, with additional study-specific information provided by the researcher, in accordance with the Lookit terms of use.

The consent document can be downloaded as a PDF document by the participant.

## Formatting custom text

You can use HTML tags in the custom text segments for additional style and formatting, e.g.`<h2>` for section headers, `<br>` for line breaks, `<strong>` for bold text, `<ol>` for ordered lists (numbered items), `<ul>` for unordered lists (bullet-pointed items), `<li>` for each list item.

```
"procedures_content": "Here is some <strong>bold</strong> text.<br><br>Here is more text after line breaks.",
```

## Parameters

### Required

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| template | String | Which consent document template to use. All GARDEN studies should use: `'consent_garden'`. |
| PIName | String | Name of PI running this study. |
| institution | String | Name of institution running this study (if ambiguous, list institution whose IRB approved the study). |
| PIContact | String | Contact information for PI or lab in case of participant questions or concerns. This will directly follow the phrase "please contact", so format accordingly: e.g., "lab@science.edu", "the XYZ lab at xyz@science.edu" or "Mary Smith at 123 456 7890". |
| study_info_description | String | Brief (one-sentence) description of study to insert into the `study_info_content` default text. This description will be inserted after 'In this study, '.<br>Note: if the default study info content is fully replaced via the `study_info_content` parameter, then this parameter will be ignored. |
| purpose_content | String | Brief description of the purpose of the study. | 
| eligibility_content | String | Eligibility criteria. Aim for stating inclusion criteria over/more prominently than exclusion criteria when possible. Example: "Any child who is currently 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-years-old and is able to understand English is able to participate as long as a main caregiver or parent (that is, someone who is legally able to make decisions for the child) gives permission." |
| procedures_content | String | Statement summarizing study procedures. This section always starts with a Lookit-generated duration statement: "This study takes about {duration} to complete.", where {duration} comes from the study details. (Note: if necessary, you can omit the duration statement by setting the `duration_statement` parameter to an empty string ("").) |
| benefits_content | String | Statement summarizing the benefits of the research to the family (direct) or to society (e.g, parents, teachers, policy makers (indirect)). Example: "Your participation in this study can help us learn more about families and their children and how families are important to child development. Although it may take a few years for us to share our findings, you will also have the opportunity to read about the study findings yourself. Although there are no other direct benefits to participation, many children/caregivers find participating in our research enjoyable." |
| data_sharing_learn | String |  Statement about what additional things might be learned from the data from this specific study, e.g., “better understand how families with 3- to 6-year-old children come from many different backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives”. This will be used to complete a sentence in the data sharing section, to explain why the data is being shared publically: "The de-identified study information will also eventually be shared with the public so other researchers can verify these findings and also see if there are other important things we can learn from the information. This will allow educators, families and other researchers to use the findings to {`data_sharing_learn`}." |
| irb_contact | String | Contact info for the research rights/IRB section. This is a string that will be appended to the end of the sentence: "If you or your child has questions or concerns about your child's rights as a research subject, or if you would like to obtain information, offer input, or report a research_related issue, you may contact: {`irb_contact`}." |


### Optional

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| include_databrary | Boolean | `false` | Whether to include a paragraph about Databrary under the video sharing and publication sections. Note that this parameter is only used if `data_collection_omit_video` is `false` (default) and `private_level_only` is `false` (default), since those parameters indicate that either no study-related video data is collected, or that the participant shouldn't have the option of sharing it. Also, if the entire video sharing section text is replaced via the `video_sharing_study` parameter, then the databrary text will NOT be automatically included in that section (but the researcher can copy the default text into the rest of their custom text). |
| summary_statement | String | `""` | Statement inserted at the beginning of the consent form, right after the intro sentence: "Researchers led by {`PIname`} at {`institution`} are running this study, "{`study name`}," on Lookit." |
| risk_content_additional | String | `""` | Additional risk statement to be added after the default text: "{experiment} only takes about {duration}, but your child may find some questions uninteresting or boring.". This parameter should be used to mention anything specific to the procedures for this study, e.g. "Your child may also not feel comfortable answering some of the questions. " (Note: if the entire risk content section text is replaced via the `risk_content` parameter, then this parameter is ignored.) |
| risk_content_discontinue_options | String | `""` | Additional study-specific discontinue options to be inserted into the default statement: "Your child may {risk_content_discontinue_options}choose to stop participating at any time." E.g. "choose to select 'prefer not to answer’ on a question or ”. If no value is given then the statment will be: "Your child may choose to stop participating at any time." (Note: if the entire risk content section text is replaced via the `risk_content` parameter, then this parameter is ignored.) |
| risk_content_breach_of_confidentiality | String | `""` | Breach of confidentiality statement, if required by your IRB. E.g. “It is possible that a breach of confidentiality may occur if Lookit is hacked, but Lookit regularly receives external security audits to prevent this and we have multiple safeguards in place to protect data security”. (Note: if the entire risk content section text is replaced via the `risk_content` parameter, then this parameter is ignored.) |
| data_collection_omit_video | Boolean | `false` | Whether or not to omit the 'Video recordings' data type form the data collection section. Default is `false`. If `true`, the section will say "There are two types of information..." (rather than "three") and only list items 1 and 2 from the default data_collection_content text.  |
| include_irb_contact_statement | Boolean | `false` | Whether or not to include the following sentence in the research rights/IRB section: "A representative of the {institution} IRB may contact you to gather information about your experience participating in this research. Just as with the research itself, you can choose to answer or not answer any questions an IRB representative may ask you.” Default is `false`. Set this to `true` if this statement is required by your IRB. |
| irb_extra | String | `""` | Use this parameter to provide any additional institution IRB specific information here, but try to avoid redundancy with any of the default text if possible. If you include this parameter, the string will be added to the end of the research rights/IRB section. (Note: If you want this content to appear as a separate paragraph, include two line break HTML tags at the start of the string: `<br><br>`). |
| private_level_only | Boolean | `false` | Whether to describe only the "private" video privacy level in the video sharing section. Only use this option if your IRB has a hard restriction against even offering participants the option to share their videos more broadly, and in conjunction with the corresponding restriction of options in the exit survey! If `true`, the text in the video sharing section will not contain the 'scientific and educational' or 'publicity' options (see Default text section below). |
| additional_video_privacy_statement | String | `""` | Additional text for the video sharing section. For cases where researchers ask for other specific permission to share videos, separate from the exit survey, or want to provide more detail or different language about Databrary sharing. If text is given, it will appear after all of the video sharing and databrary content. |
| additional_segments | Array | `[]` | List of JSON objects defining additional custom sections of the consent form, e.g. US Patriot Act Disclosure or child abuse reporting obligation disclosure. These are subject to Lookit approval and in general can only add information that was true anyway but that your IRB needs explicitly listed. Each JSON object in the array defines a section using the properties: `title`, the title of the section (string), and `text`, the text of the section (string). |

### Default text and associated parameters

This section includes the default text for each section, along with the corresponding parameter names. Each segment can be replaced by including the parameter name in your frame, along with the text string that should replace the default. The text strings can contain HTML. If you replace the default text for any of these sections, _you must write the text exactly as you want it to appear_; you can not use variables to insert information from other frame parameters or from your study details (study name, institution, etc.). Similarly, any of the required/optional parameters listed above that are intended to modify the default text are ignored if the entire text segment is replaced using the parameters below.

| data_management_header | `How do you make sure that my privacy is protected with "de-identification"?` |
| data_management_content | `Your <u>study information</u> will be de-identified by giving you and your child a “Family ID” and removing any personal information that can be used to identify you. We can give you two examples of how this “de-identification process” works:<br><br><u>Example #1</u>: In our research spreadsheets, we will use something like “F32” or “Family 32” to identify your family/your child instead of “the Smith family” or “Jane Smith”. This de-identified <u>study information</u> will be placed together with other families&rsquo; de-identified study information in spreadsheets/data files.<br><br><u>Example #2</u>: If your child is 5 years old, their information will usually be described as one of many other 5 year olds in the data set, and we will report findings saying something like “five-year-olds in this study were more likely to choose option A more often than other options” or “200 families with five-year-olds were in the Southeast U.S.”.<br><br>If you have any more questions about who has access to your information or how it will be used, please contact us using the information at the end of this consent form.

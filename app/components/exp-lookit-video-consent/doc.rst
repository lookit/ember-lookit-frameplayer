exp-lookit-video-consent
==============================================

Overview
------------------

Video consent frame for Lookit studies, with consent document displayed at left and instructions to start recording, read a statement out loud, and send. A standard consent
document is displayed, with additional study-specific information provided by the researcher, in accordance with the Lookit terms of use.

The consent document can be downloaded as a PDF document by the participant.

Researchers can select from the following named templates:

- ``consent_001``: Original Lookit consent document (2019)
- ``consent_002``: Added optional GDPR section and research subject rights statement
- ``consent_003``: Same as consent_002 except that the 'Payment' section is renamed 'Benefits, risks, and payment' for institutions that prefer that
- ``consent_004``: Same as consent_003 except that sentences in 'Data collection and webcam recording' are rearranged to make it clearer what happens if you withdraw video data, and the prompt says to read "out loud (or in ASL)" instead of just "out loud" for accessibility.
- ``consent_005``: A reworked and simplified template that fixes a lot of mildly confusing sentences. Adds a separate
  ``risk_statement`` to separate information about procedures, risks, and compensation/benefits.

Looking up exact templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To look up the exact text of each consent template for your IRB protocol, and to understand the context for
each piece of text to be inserted, please see `the templates <https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/tree/master/Legal>`__.

Formatting inserted consent text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting with consent template ``consent__005``, you can use HTML in the inserted text segments. You can add additional
sections as part of your inserted text by including ``<h2>`` tags: for instance,

.. code:: javascript

    "procedures": "Your child will be shown pictures of lots of different cats, along with noises that cats make like meowing and purring. <h2>Here is another section</h2>And some section text...",

And it will get rendered like this:

In general, you shouldn't need to do this (and the consent template is long enough as is!) but it gives you some
flexibility if there's, for instance, a really important aspect of the procedure that you want to separate out.

        "institution": "Science University",
        "PIContact": "Jane Smith at 123 456 7890",
        "purpose": "Why do babies love cats? This study will help us find out whether babies love cats because of their soft fur or their twitchy tails.",
        "procedures": "Your child will be shown pictures of lots of different cats, along with noises that cats make like meowing and purring. We are interested in which pictures and sounds make your child smile. We will ask you (the parent) to turn around to avoid influencing your child's responses.",
        "risk_statement": "There are no expected risks if you participate in the study. (This is optional, but should typically be included. If you leave it out there's no 'risks' section and you should include risk information elsewhere.)",
        "voluntary_participation": "There are two sessions in this study; you will be invited to complete another session next month. It is okay not to do both sessions! (This is optional; leave it out if you don't need to say anything besides participation in this session being voluntary.)",

To be eligible for the gift card your child must be in the age range for this study, you need to submit a valid consent statement, and we need to see that there is a child with you. But we will send a gift card even if you do not finish the whole study or we are not able to use your child's data! There are no other direct benefits to you or your child from participating, but we hope you will enjoy the experience.",

        "gdpr": false,
        "research_rights_statement": "You are not waiving any legal claims, rights or remedies because of your participation in this research study.  If you feel you have been treated unfairly, or you have questions regarding your rights as a research subject, you may contact the [IRB NAME], [INSTITUTION], [ADDRESS/CONTACT]",

Parameters
----------------

Standard fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

template [String | ``'consent_001'``]
    Which consent document template to use. If you are setting up a new study, we recommend
    using the most recent (highest number) of these options. Options: ``consent_001``,
    ``consent_002``, ``consent_003``, ``consent_004``, ``consent_005``

additional_video_privacy_statement [String]
    [Templates 5+ only] Optional additional text for under header "Who can see our webcam recordings". For cases where researchers ask for other specific permission to share videos, separate from the exit survey, or want to provide more detail or different language about Databrary sharing.

datause [String]
    Study-specific data use statement (optional). This will follow more general text like: "The research group led by [PIName] at [institution] will have access to video and other data collected during this session. We will also have access to your account profile, demographic survey, and the child profile for the child who is participating, including changes you make in the future to any of this information. We may study your child’s responses in connection with his or her previous responses to this or other studies run by our group, siblings’ responses to this or other studies run by our group, or demographic survey responses." (For exact text, please see specific template.)

    You may want to note what measures you will actually be coding for (looking time, facial expressions, parent-child interaction, etc.) and other more specific information about your use of data from this study here. For instance, you would note if you were building a corpus of naturalistic data that may be used to answer a variety of questions (rather than just collecting data for a single planned study).

gdpr [Boolean | ``false``]
    Whether to include a section on GDPR; only used in template consent_002 + .

gdpr_personal_data [String]
    List of types of personal information collected, for GDPR section only. Do not include special category information, which is listed separately.

gdpr_sensitive_data [String]
    List of types of special category information collected, for GDPR section only. Include all that apply: racial or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or philosophical beliefs; trade union membership; processing of genetic data; biometric data; health data; and/or sex life or sexual orientation information

PIName [String]
    Name of PI running this study

include_databrary [Boolean | ``false``]
    [Templates 5+ only] Whether to include a paragraph about Databrary under "Who can see our webcam recordings?".

institution [String]
    Name of institution running this study (if ambiguous, list institution whose IRB approved the study)'

PIContact [String]
    Contact information for PI or lab in case of participant questions or concerns. This will directly follow the phrase "please contact", so format accordingly: e.g., "the XYZ lab at xyz@science.edu" or "Mary Smith at 123 456 7890".

payment [String]
    Statement about payment/compensation for participation, including a statement that there are no additional
    benefits anticipated to the participant. E.g., "After you finish the study, we will email you a $5 BabyStore
    gift card within approximately three days. To be eligible for the gift card your child must be in the age
    range for this study, you need to submit a valid consent statement, and we need to see that there is a
    child with you. But we will send a gift card even if you do not finish the whole study or we are not able
    to use your child's data! There are no other direct benefits to you or your child from participating, but
    we hope you will enjoy the experience."

    For consent templates 3 and 4, this section is titled Benefits, risks, and payment; it should include information about risks as well.

    For consent template 5, this section is by default titled "Are there any benefits to your family?"; it should only include
    information about benefits and compensation. If your IRB prefers to combine risk/benefit information, you can
    change this to something like "What are the risks and benefits if you participate?" and include both here, then
    omit the ``risk_statement``.

private_level_only [Boolean | ``false``]
    [Templates 5+ only] Whether to describe only the "private" video privacy level under the heading "Who will be
    able to see your webcam recordings?" Only use this option if your IRB has a hard restriction against even offering
    participants the option to share their videos more broadly, and in conjunction with the corresponding restriction
    of options in the exit survey!

procedures
    Brief description of study procedures. For consent templates 001 and 002, this should include any
    risks or a statement that there are no anticipated risks. (For consent template 003, that is included
    in `payment`). We add a statement about the duration (from your study definition) to the start (e.g.,
    "This study takes about 10 minutes to complete"), so you don't need to include that. It can be in
    third person or addressed to the parent. E.g., "Your child will be shown pictures of lots of different
    cats, along with noises that cats make like meowing and purring. We are interested in which pictures
    and sounds make your child smile. We will ask you (the parent) to turn around to avoid influencing
    your child's responses. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating."

purpose [String]
    Brief description of purpose of study - 1-2 sentences that describe what you are trying to find out. Language should be as straightforward and accessible as possible! E.g., "Why do babies love cats? This study will help us find out whether babies love cats because of their soft fur or their twitchy tails."

research_rights_statement [String]
    Statement about rights of research subjects and how to contact IRB.  Used only in template consent_002+. For instance, MIT's standard language is: You are not waiving any legal claims, rights or remedies because of your participation in this research study.  If you feel you have been treated unfairly, or you have questions regarding your rights as a research subject, you may contact [CONTACT INFO].

risk_statement [String]
    [Templates 5+ only] Optional statement; if provided, it is displayed under a header "Are there any risks if you participate?".


voluntary_participation [String]
    [Templates 5+ only] Optional additional text for under header "Participation is voluntary". E.g., "There are two sessions in this study; you will be invited to complete another session next month. It is okay not to do both sessions!"

Additional customization available if REQUIRED by your IRB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To accommodate a variety of idiosyncratic IRB requirements, various other fields are technically customizable. Please
start by trying to get approval for a standard Lookit consent form, because it helps participants for the forms to have
common structure and language. If your IRB says no, you need to use their usual form that's 14 pages long, please explain
that Lookit requires you to use of one of our standard forms to ensure a smooth participant experience; this is in the
Terms of Use! If it really won't be possible to use Lookit without making more changes, please let us know before using
the following fields to further customize the consent form:

purpose_header [String | ``''``]
    [Templates 5+ only] Custom alternate header for the section on study purpose.

procedures_header [String | ``''``]
    [Templates 5+ only] Custom alternate header for the section on study procedures.

participation_header [String | ``''``]
    [Templates 5+ only] Custom alternate header for the section on participation being voluntary.

benefits_header [String | ``''``]
    [Templates 5+ only] Custom alternate header for the section on benefits/compensation.

risk_header [String | ``''``]
    [Templates 5+ only] Custom alternate header for risks section.

summary_statement [String]
    [Templates 5+ only] Statement inserted at the beginning of the consent form, right after "Researchers led by ...
    are running this study ... on Lookit." Please only use this if your IRB *requires* particular information to be
    included at the beginning of the form; information is usually easier for participants to find under the appropriate
    header rather than inserted here!

additional_segments [Array]
    List of additional custom sections of the consent form, e.g. US Patriot Act Disclosure or child abuse reporting obligation disclosure.
    These are subject to Lookit approval and in general can only add information that was true anyway but that your IRB
    needs explicitly listed.

    Each section can have fields:

        :title: [String] title of section
        :text: [String] text of section

prompt_all_adults [Boolean | ``false``]
    Whether to include an addition step #4 prompting any other adults present to read a statement of consent
    (I have read and understand the consent document. I also agree to participate in this study.)

prompt_only_adults [Boolean | ``false``]
    [Templates 5+ only] Whether to prompt only the adult for consent for themselves to participate, rather than also referencing a child.
    This is for occasional studies running an adult comparison group.

consent_statement_text [String]
    Replace the default consent prompt with your custom text.

omit_injury_phrase [Boolean | ``false``]
    [Templates 5+ only] Whether to omit the phrase "or in the very unlikely event of a research-related injury" from
    the contact section. (This was required by the Northwestern IRB.)

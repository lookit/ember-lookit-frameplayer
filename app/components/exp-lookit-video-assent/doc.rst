exp-lookit-video-assent
==============================================

Overview
------------------

Video assent frame for Lookit studies for older children to agree to participation,
separately from parental consent.

A series of assent form "pages" is displayed, each one displaying some combination of
(a) an image or the participant's webcam view or a video, (b) audio, and (c) text. You can
optionally record webcam video during the whole assent procedure or on the last page.

How the child assents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the family has viewed all pages, the
child can answer a question about whether to participate. If they choose yes, they proceed;
if they choose no, they are sent to the exit URL.

You can either simply have children click on "Yes" or "No," or you can add audio/video on
the last page that instructs them to answer verbally, and do webcam recording on that page.
For instance, you might show a video of yourself asking "Do you want to participate in this study?
You can say "yes" or "no." Parents, once your child has answered, please click on their answer
to the right."

Showing images, videos, webcam view, and audio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general it is expected that only one of webcam view, video, and image will be provided per
page, although it is ok to have only text or only text plus audio. If audio or video is provided for a page,
the participant must finish it to proceed. (If both audio and video are provided they will
be played simultaneously and both must finish for the participant to proceed.) They only
need to complete the audio/video for a given page once, in case they navigate using the
previous/next buttons.

Showing this frame only to older children
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This frame can optionally be shown only when the child is at least N years old, in case
some participants will need to give assent and others will rely only on parent consent.

Specifying where files are
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several of the parameters for this frame can be specified either by providing a list of full URLs and file types, or
by providing just a filename that will be interpreted relative to the ``baseDir``.
See the :ref:`expand-assets` tool that this frame uses.

More general functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is information specific to this particular frame. There may also be available parameters, events recorded,
and data collected that come from the following more general sources:

- the :ref:`base frame<base frame>` (things all frames do)
- :ref:`video-record`
- :ref:`expand-assets`

.. admonition:: Do not use with session recording
    :class: warning

    The video-assent frame is not meant to be used with simultaneous session recording. If you'd like to use session recording during your experiment, you should start the session recording *after* the video-assent frame.

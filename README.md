# ember-lookit-frameplayer

This is a small Ember application that allows both researchers to preview an experiment and users to
participate in an experiment. This is meant to be used in conjunction with the [Lookit API Django project](https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api), which contains the Experimenter and Lookit applications.
The Django applications will proxy to these Ember routes for previewing/participating in an experiment.

For installation instructions, please see the [Lookit documentation](https://lookit.readthedocs.io/projects/frameplayer/en/latest/).
